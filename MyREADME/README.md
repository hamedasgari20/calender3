__Hardhat__ is an Ethereum development environment that allows us to test, compile, and run our smart contract code. ```npm install --save-dev hardhat```
### Step 4: Create sample hardhat project
type ```npx hardhat``` and select __create a basic sample project__ then run ```npx hardhat``` to see __hardhat CLI command__

some of the commands listed below:
1. npx hardhat accounts
2. npx hardhat test

3. Rename ```test/sample-test.js``` to ```test.js```
### Step 6: Create smart contract
Add ```Calend3.sol``` in the __contracts/__ directory and compile ```npx hardhat compile```
